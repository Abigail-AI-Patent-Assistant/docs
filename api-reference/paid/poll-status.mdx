title: Poll Draft Status
openapi: "openapi.json GET /v1/openclaw/draft-roa/status/{job_id}"
---

Poll this endpoint to check the progress of an ROA drafting job.

## Status values

| Status | Meaning | `download_url` present? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queued` | Job is waiting for a worker | No |
| `in_progress` | Job is actively generating the document | No |
| `complete` | Document is ready for download | Yes |
| `failed` | Job failed (see `error_message`) | No |

## Polling strategy

Poll every 5 seconds. Typical drafting jobs complete in 30-120 seconds.

```python
import time
import httpx

def wait_for_draft(base_url, job_id, api_key, timeout=300):
    headers = {"X-API-Key": api_key}
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < timeout:
        resp = httpx.get(
            f"{base_url}/v1/openclaw/draft-roa/status/{job_id}",
            headers=headers,
        )
        data = resp.json()
        if data["status"] == "complete":
            return data["download_url"]
        if data["status"] == "failed":
            raise Exception(f"Draft failed: {data.get('error_message')}")
        time.sleep(5)
    raise TimeoutError("Draft did not complete within timeout")
```

## Download URL

The `download_url` is a signed URL that includes a JWT token. It expires after
**1 hour**. If it expires, re-poll this endpoint to get a fresh URL.

  Polling this endpoint is free and not billed.
