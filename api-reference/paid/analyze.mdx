title: Analyze Office Action
openapi: "openapi.json POST /v1/openclaw/analyze"
---

This is the core endpoint. Submit the full text of a USPTO office action and receive
a structured analysis with claim-by-claim breakdown, rejection bases, prior art mapping,
and strategic recommendations.

Every response includes [Glass Box](/concepts/glass-box) transparency metadata.

## Typical workflow

1. Call `/lookup/{app_number}` to get the examiner name
2. Call `/analyze` with the office action text
3. Use the returned `analysis_id` to call `/draft-roa`

## Office action types

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CTNF` | Non-final rejection (default) |
| `CTFR` | Final rejection |
| `CTED` | Restriction requirement |
| `CTRS` | Requirement for information |

## Examiner intelligence

When `include_examiner_intel` is `true` (default), the analysis includes examiner
behavior patterns that inform the strategy recommendations. Set to `false` to skip
this step and reduce processing time.
