title: Examiner Intelligence
openapi: "openapi.json GET /v1/openclaw/examiner/{examiner_name}"
---

Get an intelligence profile for a USPTO patent examiner, including historical
allowance rates, rejection patterns, and interview success rates.

## Name format

Examiner names must be in `LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME M` format and URL-encoded:

```
/v1/openclaw/examiner/SMITH%2C%20JOHN%20A
```

<Tip>
  Use the `/lookup` endpoint first to get the exact examiner name from a
  patent application. The `examiner_name` field in the lookup response is
  already in the correct format.
</Tip>

## Use cases

- **Pre-analysis**: Check examiner behavior before choosing a response strategy
- **Interview prep**: High `interview_success_rate` suggests scheduling an examiner interview
- **Workload assessment**: `avg_actions_to_allowance` indicates how many rounds to expect
