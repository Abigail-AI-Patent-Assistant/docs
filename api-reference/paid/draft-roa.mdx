title: Draft Response Document
openapi: "openapi.json POST /v1/openclaw/draft-roa"
---

Submits an asynchronous job to generate a Response to Office Action (ROA) document
in DOCX format. The job runs in the background via Celery workers.

## Async workflow

1. **Submit** this endpoint -- returns a `job_id` immediately
2. **Poll** `/draft-roa/status/{job_id}` until `status` is `complete`
3. **Download** the DOCX via the signed URL in the status response

## Strategy selections

Override the AI-recommended strategy for specific claims:

```json
{
  "strategy_selections": {
    "claim_1": "amend_narrow",
    "claim_2": "argue_distinction",
    "claim_5": "cancel"
  }
}
```

| Strategy | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `amend_narrow` | Narrow the claim with additional limitations |
| `argue_distinction` | Argue that the claim is already distinct from prior art |
| `cancel` | Cancel the claim |
| `argue_unexpected_results` | Argue unexpected results (for 103 rejections) |

If `strategy_selections` is empty or omitted, the AI recommendations from the
analysis are used.
