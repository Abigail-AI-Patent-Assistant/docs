Download a completed Response to Office Action document in DOCX format.

## Authentication

This endpoint uses **signed URL tokens** instead of API keys. The token is included
in the `download_url` from the Poll Draft Status endpoint response.

No `X-API-Key` header is needed -- the token IS the authentication.

## Token expiration

Download tokens expire after **1 hour**. If the token has expired, re-poll the
draft status endpoint to get a fresh URL:

```bash
# Get fresh download URL
curl -H "X-API-Key: abi_sk_..." \
  https://api.abigail.app/v1/openclaw/draft-roa/status/roa_abc123

# Use the new download_url from the response
curl -o response.docx \
  "https://api.abigail.app/v1/openclaw/download/roa_abc123?token=eyJhbGci..."
```
