title: Rate Limits
description: Request limits and throttling behavior.
---

The Abigail API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and service stability.

## Limits

| Tier | Rate | Burst |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free endpoints | 60 requests/minute | 10 requests/second |
| API key (paid) | 120 requests/minute | 20 requests/second |

Rate limits are applied per API key (for authenticated requests) or per IP address
(for free endpoints).

## Rate limit headers

Every response includes rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 117
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708732800
```

## Handling 429 responses

When rate limited, the API returns HTTP 429:

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "error_code": "rate_limited",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 3 seconds.",
  "agent_suggestion": "You are sending requests too quickly. Wait 3 seconds before retrying."
}
```

Implement exponential backoff in your agent:

```python
import time
import httpx

def call_with_retry(url, headers, json_body, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        resp = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=json_body)
        if resp.status_code == 429:
            wait = 2 ** attempt  # 1, 2, 4 seconds
            time.sleep(wait)
            continue
        return resp
    raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after retries")
```

## Billing

Paid endpoints use Stripe metered billing. You are charged per successful call:

| Endpoint | Price |
| --- | --- |
| `/v1/openclaw/analyze` | $5 per call |
| `/v1/openclaw/draft-roa` | $10 per call |
| `/v1/openclaw/examiner/{name}` | $1 per call |

Free endpoints (`/lookup`, `/deadlines`) and status polling (`/draft-roa/status`) are
never billed.

Failed requests (4xx, 5xx) are not billed.
