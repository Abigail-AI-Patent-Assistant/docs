title: Billing & Rate Limits
description: Credit-based billing, usage tracking, and rate limits.
---

The Abigail API uses a **credit-based billing system**. You purchase credits, and
usage is deducted in real-time based on token consumption. LLM usage is never blocked --
only document exports are credit-gated.

## How billing works

1. Purchase a credit package (or receive $25 welcome credits on signup)
2. Every API call that uses AI consumes tokens (input + output)
3. Token costs are deducted from your credit balance automatically
4. Every response includes balance headers so you can track spending

## Token pricing

| Service Type | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Standard Input | $50.00 per 1M tokens |
| Standard Output | $200.00 per 1M tokens |

A typical `/analyze` call processes ~2,000 input tokens and ~1,500 output tokens,
costing approximately $0.40 per analysis.

### Model multiplier

Your account has a model version setting (default 1.0x) that multiplies base token
prices. Higher-capability models may have higher multipliers.

## Credit packages

| Package | Price | Credits | Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starter | $25 | $25 | -- |
| Professional | $100 | $100 | +$10 |
| Business | $500 | $500 | +$75 |
| Enterprise | $2,000 | $2,000 | +$400 |

Custom amounts are also supported (1:1 credits, no bonus).

New accounts receive **$25 in welcome credits** to get started.

## Document export pricing

Document exports (DOCX downloads) are **credit-gated** -- the API returns HTTP 402
if your balance is insufficient.

| Document Type | Price |
| --- | --- |
| OA Response | $49.00 |
| IDS | $9.00 |
| Form | $5.00 |
| Drawing | $5.00 |

<Warning>
  Document exports are the only operations that block on insufficient credits.
  All LLM-based operations (analyze, examiner lookup) always complete regardless
  of balance.
</Warning>

## What is free?

These operations are never billed:

- `GET /v1/openclaw/lookup/{app_number}` -- application metadata
- `GET /v1/openclaw/deadlines/{app_number}` -- response deadlines
- `GET /v1/openclaw/draft-roa/status/{job_id}` -- polling draft status
- `GET /v1/openclaw/download/{job_id}` -- downloading a completed DOCX (the draft
  submission is billed, not the download)

## Usage tracking headers

Every response from authenticated endpoints includes these headers:

```
X-Credit-Balance: 142.50
X-Balance-Status: healthy
X-Usage-Requests-Today: 23
X-Usage-Requests-Hour: 5
```

### Balance status thresholds

| Status | Balance | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `healthy` | > $25 | Normal operation |
| `low` | $10 -- $25 | Consider purchasing more credits |
| `very_low` | $5 -- $10 | Running low |
| `critical` | < $5 | Nearly depleted |

When balance is `low` or below, responses also include:

```
X-Purchase-Prompt: true
X-Purchase-Message: Your credit balance is low. Purchase more credits to continue using AI features.
```

## Handling 402 responses

When a document export is blocked for insufficient credits:

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "error_code": "insufficient_credits",
  "message": "Insufficient credits for OA Response export ($49.00 required).",
  "agent_suggestion": "The user needs to purchase more credits before exporting this document. Current balance is insufficient."
}
```

Your agent should inform the user to purchase credits and retry.

## Rate limits

| Tier | Rate | Burst |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free endpoints | 60 requests/minute | 10 requests/second |
| API key (authenticated) | 120 requests/minute | 20 requests/second |

Rate limits are per API key (authenticated) or per IP (free endpoints).

### Rate limit headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 117
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1708732800
```

### Handling 429 responses

```python
import time
import httpx

def call_with_retry(url, headers, json_body, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        resp = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=json_body)
        if resp.status_code == 429:
            wait = 2 ** attempt  # 1, 2, 4 seconds
            time.sleep(wait)
            continue
        return resp
    raise Exception("Rate limit exceeded after retries")
```
